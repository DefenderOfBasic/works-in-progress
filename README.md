# âœ¨ Works in Progress ðŸŒˆ

this is an experiment in collaborative writing blogging. i'm trying to fill the space between:

1. twitter, where I can post reflections & half thoughts that build upon others' thoughts, and others build on my own
2. substack, where I blog about my "finished" thoughts after figuring out stuff, summarizing the journey
3. evergreen essays, where I continually update my beliefs

the way I'm picturing this is:

- I will create an issue for each article I am working on, this will act as a "public draft"
- the "evergreen essays" will be markdown or HTML pushed as code to the repo, so that changes to it can be made as PRs, so you can see the history of why my beliefs have changed
- anyone is welcome to "steal" anything from here. If I am struggling with a draft, you can take the pieces and write your own version. If your articulation blows my mind, I may steal it back, tweaking it in my own words, back into an "evergreen essay"
- anyone is welcome to fork the entire thing or open a PR to correct me if they think one of my beliefs is wrong/bad/missing things etc.

the LessWrong community feels like the closest thing to this. the only missing piece for me is that I need to keep track of "my own" journey as I figure things out for myself. there may be an important truth that everyone I admire believes, but I don't get it, and this is the space where I work on it, collect the pieces around it, maybe others help me, and when I finally get it I write what helped me get it. if others were stuck like me, this allows me to share my process with them. and vice versa, if I find someone whose ideas I resonate, I can go read through (1) what they figured out in the past and how (2) what they're currently working on, and maybe I can help them with it
