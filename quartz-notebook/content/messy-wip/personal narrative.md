title: My Personal Narrative
---

_(this is me trying to figure out my story. how I get here, where I'm going next)_

What are my interests? my drives? what's my story, y'know? Bret Victor is a man who sees a future of human-computer interaction and is trying to bring that into existence. Tom Fulp holds a creative ecosystem on his shoulders.

What is my niche? What are the things I am good at, that I really enjoy, that I am equipped to contribute to?

(do I need a niche? can I just be alive? redundancy is good Actually. There's plenty of work to do)

- open web. I love the internet so much. I love what it does for us. 

I think I can just like, explain stuff to people, who feel dumb because they don't get it? 

- I can explain music, instrumental music
- poetry?? I used to not get it
- Same with film, and film genres (video logos anyone???)
- shaders man. that was my calling, right fucking there.

(^ this seems obvious & true)


### what is my identity?

- writer 
- translator (between semiotic domains)
- technologist ? 
- teacher? 
- debugger of man & machine
