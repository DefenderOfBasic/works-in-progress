we can still find truth even though language is fuzzy

> For a data nerd like me, there’s something reassuring about visualizations like these. Yes, **language is fuzzy, almost everything is a “spectrum,” and “reality,” whatever that means, is hard to pin down**. However, the data reveal a strong underlying degree of agreement about what people _mean_ when they talk about their own handedness. Put another way: handedness is real.


>  an essential feature of the way language is used to mark out and constantly renegotiate the way we all think about things. Without that give and take, language couldn’t evolve.
