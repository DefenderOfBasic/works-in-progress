- Everyone has this? Like, I don't know, Da Vinci or whatever is really famous for mona lisa, but he did a million other things. But there's one thing that had outsized influences and fame and fortune
	- this feels like bragging? I'm trying to say, I've done a lot of cool shit but there's one thing that took off and it wasn't even "my best work"
- I have this thing and it was the very first thing I ever wrote,

In 2012 i wrote my first ever tutorial. It was also by far the most popular thing I've ever written. It was the first result on google for "graphics shader tutorial" for 6 years. I got paid $200 for it.

Not mad, it helped me get an internship at a game studio $6k a month for the summer. A bunch of ex AAA people.
