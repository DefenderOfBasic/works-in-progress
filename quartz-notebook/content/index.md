# What I'm currently working on

- Writing an "open source book about my vision for the future"? https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/t/book
	- this is a personal work of art
	- it's also meant to (maybe) help me make money/start my writing career?
	- in its best possible version this inspires people to improve things, or helps me find collaborators
	- if it "fails", then I will have learned a lot about (1) why my attempts to improve the world aren't working (2) what is a better path for me to try, given my skillset & the current problems 
- "I come in good faith", a handbook for how to argue effectively online: https://github.com/DefenderOfBasic/in-good-faith-handbook
