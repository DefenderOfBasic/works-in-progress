This is an open notebook. 

this is an experiment in collaborative writing blogging. i'm trying to fill the space between:

1. twitter, where I can post reflections & half thoughts that build upon others' thoughts, and others build on my own
2. substack, where I blog about my "finished" thoughts after figuring out stuff, summarizing the journey
3. evergreen essays, where I continually update my beliefs
