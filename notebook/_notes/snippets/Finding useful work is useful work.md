I think this is true. I experienced this first when maintaining an open source library. There were a ton of capable volunteers willing to help out. The bottleneck was in (1) what we should do and (2) what is the best way to implement it & test it.

Then I kept hearing this being true of academia/research. The most valuable thing is a well-scoped problem. You want to find an open problem that (1) no one else has solved yet, AND (2) you can solve with the resources you have.

There's a weird paradox here where:

- as a student, I had a ton of time & energy, but had no idea what I could work on that would be useful
- as a professional, I had a *ton* of ideas about useful work. I could see, inside my company, that if tool XYZ existed, we would definitely pay for it/use it/build on it

I've lived with this paradox a lot. How can the world be so broken, in so many ways, and yet I am struggling to find meaningful ways to contribute to making it better? 

The answer is simple: 
##### it's because finding work *is* work. 

It's not really rewarded by itself. You are rewarded for *completing* useful work, not for finding it. Also, even if someone shared 
### What if there was another way?
