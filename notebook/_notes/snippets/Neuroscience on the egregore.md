James says "the observer effect applies in social science AND physics". I want to take this further: can we study things in the ways we want them to change?

Like debugging a system, but changing it to make it easier to debug. It is no longer just an objective scientist studying a system without changing it. it is in not possible. it is not possible for collective sentience to study itself without affecting itself

but it is ok. you don't have to *fully* understand it, really. You can change it in predictable ways. Just like a mind does when focuses attention on itself. 

I think this is where science & religion meet.
