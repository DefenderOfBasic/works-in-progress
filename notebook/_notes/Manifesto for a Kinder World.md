- I'm not talking about kindness like, "being nice to each other". I'm talking about "despair won't feed the kids in africa, they can't eat your despair"
	- if I'm driving on the wrong side of the wrong, and my friends are kind & nice and don't say anything, this will get me killed. 
	- competence is kind. caring enough to say something is kind.


- the first peace treaty in history was between two countries that didn't speak each other's languages. Both kings declared to their people victory. it was great!
	- we no longer have this option, of peace through ignorance

- when someone writes or makes a thing I was working on/wish I had done, i don't envy them, I thank them, and I build on it! we are coworkers!
	- if they aren't making something that I can contribute to, then they haven't stolen my idea. my ideas cannot be stolen

### The narrative

Here's what happened in 2025.

Someone publishes "my vision for utopia". People in tpot love it, amplify it. It reaches wider circles, people dunk on it, say this is awful.

They respond with _their utopia_. Oh shit, now you have each tribe kind of looking at a document of what _their_ world looks like, when everything is solved. Project 2025, but written as to what it will look like, NOT what it's fighting against.



### Projects

#### (1) communal science 


#### (2) "In good faith"

Both as a performance piece, a book, a how to guide, and like a peer learning community

See also "r/AmIArguingInBadFaith"

"epistemic mobs" doing this together

a blog of people criticizing their in-group, privately (and publicly?)

#### (3) everyone's personal body of work

This is like the "work-in-progress" thing I'm doing on github.

I think this is related to "communal science"

#### (4) Communal ownership of data

Export your twitter archive, share it. Export your reddit data. Export your ad watch history. We analyze our own data together. We, as people, find the answers. We level up everyone. We don't trust individuals, we trust the collective. 

"verified & verifiable"

#### (5) Remix everything

it is the only way to truly get the best thing. Open source, everyone contributing. I don't want to just read the book, I want to read a hundred people rewriting THE SAME BOOK.

@lemonaut1 (todo find open source art tweet)

art as folklore. SiliconJungle, blurring the line between consumption and creation. 

#### Other ideas

- all art can be remixed, what does *that* world look like?
- start with yourself. develop your taste for truth. 
- little social games that go viral
	- this is BIG because it can transcend language, connect communities that otherwise may never connect 
- ðŸ’¡ part of this book can be a video essay??? and why not?
