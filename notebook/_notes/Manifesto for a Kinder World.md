- I'm not talking about kindness like, "being nice to each other". I'm talking about "despair won't feed the kids in africa, they can't eat your despair"
	- if I'm driving on the wrong side of the wrong, and my friends are kind & nice and don't say anything, this will get me killed. 
	- competence is kind. caring enough to say something is kind.


- the first peace treaty in history was between two countries that didn't speak each other's languages. Both kings declared to their people victory. it was great!
	- we no longer have this option, of peace through ignorance

	
### Projects

#### (1) communal science 


#### (2) "In good faith"

Both as a performance piece, a book, a how to guide, and like a peer learning community

See also "r/AmIArguingInBadFaith"

"epistemic mobs" doing this together

a blog of people criticizing their in-group, privately (and publicly?)

#### (3) everyone's personal body of work

This is like the "work-in-progress" thing I'm doing on github.

I think this is related to "communal science"
