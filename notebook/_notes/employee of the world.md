title: Employee of the world
---

- recurring idea for me. seeing everyone as coworkers. my goal isn't to be king/ceo but to contribute meaningfully
- find useful work to do. help others. cross team collaboration. look at the things society is lacking and focus on them. 
- "the modern human works 24/7", just like the ancient human did. we just don't see a lot of work as work. but it is work! and it matters 


> Checking this Twitter account feels like checking my work slack (in that I feel a sense of purpose & belonging, there's projects to check on and help out with and lend my voice to)
>
> Except instead of making money the goal is learning about ourselves & the human spirit

### Who are my coworkers?

Seeing people doing the same work I'm doing, reframe that from "competitors" in a zero sum game to "coworkers" in the project of creating a kinder world.
