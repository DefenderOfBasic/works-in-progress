title: Employee of the world
---

- recurring idea for me. seeing everyone as coworkers. my goal isn't to be king/ceo but to contribute meaningfully
- find useful work to do. help others. cross team collaboration. look at the things society is lacking and focus on them. 
- "the modern human works 24/7", just like the ancient human did. we just don't see a lot of work as work. but it is work! and it matters
