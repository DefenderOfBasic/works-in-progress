- if people are so gullible, and companies so evil, why are we not using that fact for good? can people be manipulated into being better?? (I think people are persuadable, but not as persuadable as some think)

what makes for good marketing? (it is honest, it creates value, it is good communication) TODO: who wrote a thing about marketing for engineers? 

- lima beans vs butter beans
	- yes it is technically manipulative. but also, it is good for you? if you actually genuinely enjoy the bean, but you were put off by the name?
